## A Simple Calculator

I made this by following a tutorial article on Medium.com.

I wanted to brush up on my React knowledge and this is one project that's simple, touches on the general things used in React apps, and to just help make better grasp React. 

The css is all from my own research and knowledge since the tutorial was essentially reading to understand then to copy the code over into my own React app.
